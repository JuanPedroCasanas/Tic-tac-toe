# Tic-tac-toe

Tic tac toe project with functioning AI based on a minimax algorithm
3 difficulty modes => *Easy: Completely random moves
                      *Medium: Alternates between a minimax generated moved and a random move randomly
                      *Hard: Minimax AI, technically unbeatable.

The project is considered finished altough maybe in the future i'll add prunning to the minimax function because there is a considerable lag spike when the first move is picked in hard AI or medium AI if the first move is a minimax generated one (After that the lag ceases and the game plays properly).
